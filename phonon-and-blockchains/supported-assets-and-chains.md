# Supported Assets and Chains

Because phonon is agnostic of any blockchain, what's in a phonon doesn't matter. However, the phonon protocol supports any crypto-asset that uses the Secp256k1 signing curve.&#x20;

Having that said, the following chains have asset validators developed outside of the protocol that can be used in the development of phonon-based applications.
