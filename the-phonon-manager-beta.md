# The Phonon Manager (beta)

The Phonon Manager is an upcoming software application users can run to manage their phonons on their Phonon Cards.  The software is currently in development and will be released shortly after the beta release of the new Phonon Protocol.

Here's a couple sneak peek videos of the upcoming Phonon Manager:

The following things will be changing as the protocol is evolving:

* We are moving to a <mark style="color:red;">messaged based method</mark> of phonon transfer, so the pairing experience shared in the videos above will change.
* Mining native phonons has been removed from the beta release of the Phonon Protocol.

More coming soon!
